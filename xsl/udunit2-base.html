            The second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the

            levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom.

            The ampere is that constant current which, if maintained in two
            straight parallel conductors of infinite length, of negligible
            circular cross-section, and placed 1 meter apart in vacuum, would
            produce between these conductors a force equal to 2e-7 newton
            per meter of length.

            1. The mole is the amount of substance of a system which contains
            as many elementary entities as there are atoms in 0.012 kilogram of
            carbon 12.

            2. When the mole is used, the elementary entities must be specified
            and may be atoms, molecules, ions, electrons, other particles, or
            specified groups of such particles.

            hertz and that has a radiant intensity in that direction of 1/683
            watt per steradian.
